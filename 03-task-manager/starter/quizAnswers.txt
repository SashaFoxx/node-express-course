- Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.
    Middleware in an Express application is a series of functions that execute in sequence, 
processing HTTP requests and responses. 
It's used to perform tasks like authentication, logging, error handling, and more. 
Middleware functions can be added to specific routes or applied globally to the entire application, 
allowing you to modularize and control the flow of requests and responses 
in a flexible and organized manner.

- What does CRUD stand for?
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. 
It's a set of basic operations in a database or application that represent the four 
fundamental functions for managing data. 

- You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
    a. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?
To access the information stored in a .env file in your application, you typically use a library or 
package that can read and load the environment variables from that file. 
One common library for this purpose in JavaScript/Node.js applications is `dotenv`.
First, make sure you have the `dotenv` package installed in your project (npm install dotenv).
Create a `.env` file in your project's root directory and store your sensitive information as key-value pairs.
In your application code (usually at the entry point, like `app.js`), require the `dotenv` 
library and load the environment variables from the .env file by calling `config()`. You can now access these environment variables in your code using `process.env`. 

     b. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?
to add the .env file to your `.gitignore` to avoid accidentally sharing sensitive information when using Github repository.
